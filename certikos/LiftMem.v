(** * Prerequisites *)

(** We're going to lift the memory operations and theorems from a base
  type [bmem] to a "richer" type [mem], which contains [bmem] as a
  component. Formally, this means that we have a [Lens mem bmem] which
  provides us with well-behaved accessors to the [bmem] component
  inside of [mem]. While this is enough to lift most of the memory
  operations and theorems, we do have additional prerequisites. *)

(** First, in order to lift [MemoryOps], we need to know the value of
  the empty memory state of the richer type [mem]; indeed there's no
  way we would be able to construct that just from [empty : bmem].
  However, the simpler memory state contained within this empty [mem]
  should correspond to the empty [bmem] from the base memory states. *)

Class LiftMemoryOps {mem bmem: Type} (π: mem -> bmem)
  `{bmem_ops: Mem.MemoryOps bmem}
  `{bmem_get: !Getter π}
  `{bmem_set: !Setter π} :=
{
  liftmem_empty: mem
}.

Class LiftMemoryStates {mem bmem: Type} (π: mem -> bmem)
  `{mem_liftops: LiftMemoryOps _ _ π}: Prop :=
{
  liftmem_lens :> Lens π;
  liftmem_get_empty: get π liftmem_empty = Mem.empty
}.

(** Furthermore, we need to know how the extra information fits with
  memory injections. Indeed, we could decide that, if the smaller
  [bmem] contained inside two [mem]'s inject into one another, then
  the larger memory states also inject into one another (that is,
  ignore the extra information for the purposes of memory injections),
  but then we would have no guarantee at all regarding the way in
  which this extra information evolves with program execution.
  The other extreme would be to simply make use of the powerset
  functor to lift [inject], so that two large memory states would
  inject into one another only if they contain exactly the same
  extra information. But this means it would be impossible for
  this extra information to evolve with program execution.

  Instead, we simply let the user specify how the extra information
  affects injection by giving a relation on the larger structures
  which is independent of the original memory states which are
  contained within. This is expressed by the
  [liftmem_inject_same_context] hypothesis below. Relations which
  respect this requirement are equivalent to relations on the quotient
  sets [mem / same_context], where [same_context] relates two larger
  memory states which differ only by the base memory state they
  contain. *)

  liftmem_inject_same_context :>
    Proper (same_context σ ==> same_context τ ==> impl) liftmem_context_inject
}.

(** For homogenous injections, we must also require that [context_inject]
  be reflexive, so as to prove [neutral_inject]. If that proves to be too
  restrictive, we could introduce the equivalent [inject_neutral] for the
  context, and weaken the following to require only that [inject_neutral]
  elements be proper. *)

  (** Because [Mem.MemoryModel] contains so many theorems, we need some
    systematic way to lift the memory operations on [W mem], so that
    the lifting of the theorems is convenient to automate.

    The signature of most of the memory operations are variations on
    the theme [mem -> F mem], where [F] is a functor such as [option]
    or [- * Z]. We need to lift them to [W mem -> F (W mem)]. Note
    that using the comonad's [fmap] is not possible because that would
    yield a function of type [W mem -> W (F mem)]. Instead, we use
    the following: *)

    lift f m := fmap (fun bm => set π bm m) (f (get π m))
