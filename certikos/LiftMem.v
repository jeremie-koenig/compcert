Section LIFT.
  Context `{HW: ComonadOps} `{HF: Functor} {mem: Type}.

  (** Because [Mem.MemoryStates] contains so many theorems, we need some
    systematic way to lift the memory operations on [W mem], so that
    the lifting of the theorems is convenient to automate.

    The signature of most of the memory operations are variations on
    the theme [mem -> F mem], where [F] is a functor such as [option]
    or [- * Z]. We need to lift them to [W mem -> F (W mem)]. Note
    that using the comonad's [fmap] is not possible because that would
    yield a function of type [W mem -> W (F mem)]. Instead, we use
    the following: *)

  Definition lift (f: mem -> F mem) (wm: W mem) :=
    fmap (fun m' => set m' wm) (f (extract wm)).

  (** Here are some basic theorems about [lift] with any functor. *)

  Theorem lift_mor (f g: mem -> F mem) (wa: W mem):
    f (extract wa) = g (extract wa) ->
    lift f wa = lift g wa.
  Proof.
    intros Hfg.
    unfold lift.

(** * Lifting the properties *)

(** Now we lift the properties listed in [Mem.MemoryStates]: given a theorem
  about [mem], we need to prove the equivalent theorem about [W mem]
  and the corresponding lifted operations it involves. To do this,
  we need some theorems about lift to help us rewrite our lifted goals
  to use the original theorems. *)
