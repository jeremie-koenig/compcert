  (** Because [Mem.MemoryStates] contains so many theorems, we need some
    systematic way to lift the memory operations on [W mem], so that
    the lifting of the theorems is convenient to automate.

    The signature of most of the memory operations are variations on
    the theme [mem -> F mem], where [F] is a functor such as [option]
    or [- * Z]. We need to lift them to [W mem -> F (W mem)]. Note
    that using the comonad's [fmap] is not possible because that would
    yield a function of type [W mem -> W (F mem)]. Instead, we use
    the following: *)
